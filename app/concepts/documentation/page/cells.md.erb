<%= page title: "Cells" %>

Out of the frustration with Rails' view layer, its lack of encapsulation and the convoluted code resulting from partials and helpers both accessing global state, the [Cells](https://github.com/apotonick/cells) gem emerged.

The cells gem is completely stand-alone and can be used without Trailblazer.

A cell is an object that represent a fragment of your UI. The scope of that fragment is up to you: it can embrace an entire page, a single comment container in a thread or just an avatar image link.

In other words: **A cell is an object that can render a template.**
