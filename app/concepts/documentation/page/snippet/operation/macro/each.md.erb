<%= h3 "Each" %>

As the name suggests, you can loop over one or more steps using this macro.

<%= code "op", collapse: "methods" %>

This is simply an extension over [Wrap](#operation-macros-wrap) macro where you can configure how many times the wrapped block should be iterated upon at runtime.

It accepts a [callable](/2.1/docs/trailblazer.html#trailblazer-option) enumerator as first argument and a `key` mapping in order to access the current element within wrapped steps.

<%= code "proc-callable" %>

<%= h4 "Break" %>

The loop can break from iterating and go to the failure track if any step returns a failure signal.

<%= vite_image_tag "images/each-break.webp", class: "mx-auto d-block" %>

The loop won't be iterated either if the callable does not return an enumerable object by raising `Each::EnumerableNotGiven` exception.
