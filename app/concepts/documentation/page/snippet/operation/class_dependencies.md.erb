<%= h3 "Class Dependencies" %>

If you want to configure values or dependencies on the operation class level, use the `ClassDependencies` module.

<%= info do %>
The usage of this feature is not recommended. Use a dry-container instead.
<% end %>

You may use the `self[]=` setter to add directives to the operation class.

These variables will be available within every step of the operation *and after*.

<%= code "create" %>

Starting with the invocation of the `Create` operation, the `validator` variable is injected into the `ctx` and passed on.

<%= code "validate" %>

The variable is readable from `ctx` even when the operation finishes - so be careful in nested setups.

<%= code "invoke" %>

<%= info do %>
Note that variables from within a nested operation are readable in the outer operation after the nested one has been invoked.
<% end %>
