<%= h2 "Function API" %>

Both rendering and parsing have a rich API that allows you to hook into particular steps and change behavior.

If that still isn't enough, you can create your own pipeline.

<%= h3 "Overview" %>

Function option are passed to `property`.

~~~ ruby
property :id, default: "n/a"
~~~

Most options accept a static value, like a string, or a dynamic lambda.

~~~ ruby
property :id, if: ->(options) { options[:fragment].nil? }
~~~

The `options` hash is passed to **all options** and has the following members.

    {doc: doc, options: options, represented: represented, decorator: self}

    options[:doc] | When rendering, the document as it gets created. When parsing, the entire document.
    options[:fragment] | When parsing, this is the fragment read from the document corresponding to this property.
    options[:input] | When rendering, this is the value read from the represented object corresponding to this property.
    options[:represented] | The currently represented object.
    options[:decorator] | The current decorator instance.
    options[:binding] | The current binding instance. This allows to access the currently used definition, e.g. `options[:binding][:name]`.
    options[:options] | All options that have been passed into the render or parse method.
    options[:user_options] | The `:user_options` for the current representer. These are only the [nested options](#nested-user-options) from the user, for a particular representer.

In your option function, you can either receive the entire options hash and use it in the block.

~~~ ruby
if: ->(options) { options[:fragment].nil? }
~~~

Or, and that is the preferred way, use Ruby's keyword arguments.

~~~ ruby
if: ->(fragment:, **) { fragment.nil? }
~~~

<%= h3 "As" %>

If your property name doesn't match the name in the document, use the :as option.

~~~ ruby
property :title, as: :name
~~~

This will render using the `:as` value. Vice-versa for parsing

~~~ ruby
song.to_json #=> {"name":"Fallout","track":1}
~~~

<%= h3 "Getter" %>

When rendering, Representable calls the property's getter on the represented object. For a property named `:id`, this will result in `represented.id` to retrieve the value for rendering.

You can override this, and instead of having Representable call the getter, run your own logic.

~~~ ruby
property :id, getter: ->(represented:, **) { represented.uuid.human_readable }
~~~

In the rendered document, you will find the UUID now where should be the ID.

~~~ ruby
decorator.to_json #=> {"id": "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6"}
~~~

As helpful as this option is, please do not overuse it. A representer is not a data mapper, but a document transformer. If your underlying data model and your representers diverge too much, consider using a [twin](/2.1/docs/disposable.html) to simplify the representer.

<%= h3 "Setter" %>

After parsing has happened, the fragment is assigned to the represented object using the property's setter. In the above example, Representable will call `represented.id=(fragment)`.

Override that using `:setter`.

~~~ ruby
property :id,
  setter: ->(fragment:, represented:, **) { represented.uuid = fragment.upcase }
~~~

Again, don't overuse this method and consider a twin if you find yourself using `:setter` for every property.

<%= h3 "If" %>

You can exclude properties when rendering or parsing, as if they were not defined at all. This works with `:if`.

~~~ ruby
property :id, if: ->(user_options:,**) { user_options[:is_admin] }
~~~

When parsing (or rendering), the `id` property is only considered when `is_admin` has been passed in.

This will parse the `id` field.

~~~ ruby
decorator.from_json('{"id":1}', user_options: {is_admin: true})
~~~

<%= h3 "Reader" %>

To override the entire parsing process, use `:reader`. You won't have access to `:fragment` here since parsing hasn't happened, yet.

~~~ ruby
property :id,
  reader: ->(represented:,doc:,**) { represented.payload = doc[:uuid] || "n/a" }
~~~

With `:reader`, parsing is completely up to you. Representable will only invoke the function and do nothing else.

<%= h3 "Writer" %>

To override the entire rendering process, use `:writer`. You won't have access to `:input` here since the value query to the represented object hasn't happened, yet.

~~~ ruby
property :id,
  writer: ->(represented:,doc:,**) { doc[:uuid] = represented.id }
~~~

With `:writer`, rendering is completely up to you. Representable will only invoke the function and do nothing else.

<%= h3 "Skip Parse" %>

To suppress parsing of a property, use `:skip_parse`.

~~~ ruby
property :id,
  skip_parse: ->(fragment:,**) { fragment.nil? || fragment=="" }
~~~

No further processing happens with this property, should the option evaluate to true.

<%= h3 "Skip Render" %>

To suppress rendering of a property, use `:skip_render`.

~~~ ruby
property :id,
  skip_render: ->(represented:,**) { represented.id.nil? }
~~~

No further processing happens with this property, should the option evaluate to true.

<%= h3 "Parse Filter" %>

Use `:parse_filter` to process the parsing result.

~~~ ruby
property :id,
  parse_filter: ->(fragment, options) { fragment.strip }
~~~

Just before setting the fragment to the object via the setter, the `:parse_filter` is called.

Note that you can add multiple filters, the result from the last will be passed to the next.

<%= h3 "Render Filter" %>

Use `:render_filter` to process the rendered fragment.

~~~ ruby
property :id,
  render_filter: ->(input, options) { input.strip }
~~~

Just before rendering the fragment into the document, the `:render_filter` is invoked.

Note that you can add multiple filters, the result from the last will be passed to the next.

<%= h3 "Deserialize" %>

When deserializing a nested fragment, the default mechanics after decorating the represented object are to call `represented.from_json(fragment)`.

Override this step using `:deserialize`.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  deserialize: ->(input:,fragment:,**) { input.attributes = fragment }
~~~

The `:input` option provides the currently deserialized object.

<%= h3 "Serialize" %>

When serializing a nested object, the default mechanics after decorating the represented object are to call `represented.to_json`.

Override this step using `:serialize`.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  serialize: ->(represented:,**) { represented.attributes.to_h }
~~~

<%= h3 "Extend" %>

Alias: `:decorator`.

When rendering or parsing a nested object, that represented object needs to get decorated, which is configured via the `:extend` option.

You can use `:extend` to configure an explicit representer module or decorator.

~~~ ruby
property :artist, extend: ArtistRepresenter
~~~

Alternatively, you could also compute that representer at run-time.

For parsing, this could look like this.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  extend: ->(fragment:,**) do
    fragment["type"] == "rockstar" ? RockstarRepresenter : ArtistRepresenter
  end
~~~

For rendering, you could do something as follows.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  extend: ->(input:,**) do
    input.is_a?(Rockstar) ? RockstarRepresenter : ArtistRepresenter
  end
~~~

This allows a dynamic polymorphic representer structure.

<%= h3 "Prepare" %>

The default mechanics when representing a nested object is decorating the object, then calling the serializer or deserializer method on it.

You can override this step using `:prepare`.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  prepare: ->(represented:,**) { ArtistRepresenter.new(input) }
~~~

Just for fun, you could mimic the original behavior.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  prepare: ->(represented:,binding:,**) { binding[:extend].new(represented) }
~~~

<%= h3 "Class" %>

When parsing a nested fragment, Representable per default creates an object for you. The class can be defined with `:class`.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  class: Artist
~~~

It could also be dynamic.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  class: ->(fragment) { fragment["type"] == "rockstar" ? Rockstar : Artist }
~~~

<%= h3 "Instance" %>

Instead of using `:class` you can directly instantiate the represented object yourself using `:instance`.

~~~ ruby
property :artist,
  instance: ->(fragment) do
    fragment["type"] == "rockstar" ? Rockstar.new : Artist.new
  end
~~~

<%= h3 "Render Nil" %>

In Representable, `false` values are considered as a valid value and will be rendered into the document or parsed.

If you want `nil` values to be included when rendering, use the `:render_nil` option.

~~~ ruby
property :title,
  render_nil: true
~~~

<%= h3 "Render Empty" %>

Per default, empty collections are rendered (unless they're `nil`). You can suppress rendering.

~~~ ruby
collection :songs,
  render_empty: false
~~~
