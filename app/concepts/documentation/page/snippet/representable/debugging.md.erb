<%= h2 "Debugging" %>

Representable is a generic mapper using recursions, pipelines and things that might be hard to understand from the outside. That's why we got the `Debug` module which will give helpful output about what it's doing when parsing or rendering.

You can extend objects on the run to see what they're doing.

    SongRepresenter.new(song).extend(Representable::Debug).from_json("..")
    SongRepresenter.new(song).extend(Representable::Debug).to_json

It's probably a good idea not to do this in production.
