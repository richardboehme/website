<%= h3 "assert_exposes" %>

Test attributes of an arbitrary object.

Pass a hash of key/value tuples to `assert_exposes` to test that all attributes of the asserted object match the provided values.

<%= code "exp-eq" %>

Per default, this will read the values via `model.{key}` from the asserted object (`model`) and compare it to the expected values.

This is a short-cut for tests such as the following.

~~~ ruby
assert_equal "Timebomb", model.title
assert_equal "Rancid",   model.band
~~~

Note that `assert_exposes` accepts any object with a reader interface.

<%= h4 "Reader" %>

If the asserted object exposes a hash reader interface, use the `:reader` option.

<%= code "exp-reader-hash" %>

This will read values with via `#[]`, e.g. `model[:title]`.

If the object has a generic reader, you can pass the name via `:reader`.

<%= code "exp-reader-get" %>

Now the value is read via `model.get(:title)`.

<%= h4 "Lambda" %>

You can also pass a lambda to `assert_expose` in order to compute a dynamic value for the test, or for more complex comparisons.

<%= code "exp-proc" %>

The lambda will receive a hash with the `:actual` value read from the asserted object. It must return a boolean.
