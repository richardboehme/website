TRB PRO is a subscription-based service that offers you a commercial license, additional gems, and access to our visual editor and to our private PRO Slack workspace for casual support.

It will be launched in February 2020.

* Paid gems: `trailblazer-workflow` and `trailblazer-activity-implementation` that both help implementing long-running processes using the editor.
* The commercial license can [be found here](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer/blob/master/COMM-LICENSE).
