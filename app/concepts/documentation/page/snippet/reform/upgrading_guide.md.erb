<%= h2 "Upgrading Guide" %>

We try to make upgrading as smooth as possible. Here's the generic documentation, but don't hesitate to ask for [help on Zulip](https://trailblazer.zulipchat.com/).

<%= h3 "2.2 to 2.3" %>

If you have been using dry-validation and you want to upgrade to version 1.x, get ready to change a lot of your code, unfortunately dry-validation API has been completely rewritten so we had to adapt. If instead you have ActiveModel/ActiveRecord the upgrade from 2.2 to 2.3 should be nice and easy.
Please refer to the [CHANGES](https://github.com/trailblazer/reform/blob/master/CHANGES.md) in the repo.

<%= h3 "2.1 to 2.2" %>

In a Rails environment with ActiveModel/ActiveRecord, you have to include the [reform-rails](https://github.com/trailblazer/reform-rails) gem.


	gem "reform"
	gem "reform-rails"


<%= h3 "1.2 to 2.0" %>

#### Validations

Validations like `validates_acceptance_of` are not available anymore, you have to use the new syntax.


	validates acceptance: true


#### Form#valid?

Using `form.valid?` is a private concept and was never publicly documented. It is still available (private) but you are strongly recommended to use `#validate` instead.

#### Form#update!

Apparently, some people used `form.update!({..})` to pre-fillout forms. `#update!` has never been publicly documented and got removed in Reform 2. However, you can achieve the same behavior using the following hack.


	Reform::Form.class_eval do
	  alias_method :update!, :deserialize
	  public :update!


#### Validation Backend

This only is necessary when _not_ using `reform/rails`, which is automatically loaded in a Rails environment.

In an initializer, e.g. `config/initializers/reform.rb`.


	require "reform/form/active_model/validations"
	Reform::Form.class_eval do
	  include Reform::Form::ActiveModel::Validations
	end
